PyBEM2D Changelog

Build 20190702
1. Point source supported
2. Code structure is simplified again
3. Few examples are added
4. Due to point source, the code now only support Orthotropic instead of Anisotropic.

Build 20180712
1. Discontinous constant,linear and quadratic element is supported
2. Exact analytical integrations for all elements is added
3. Anisotropic properties is supported
3. Key calculations are acclerated by Cython (40X improvements)
4. Thanks to exact integration. The Code structure is simplifed and updated. 
	-BEM_2D is splitted into BEM_2D,BEM_2D_Mesh and BEM_2D_PostProcess
	-Matrix assembler for different elements is unified.
5. The visulization tools are improved and updated.
6. Serveral examples are added and verified with FEM Solution.

Build 20180603

1. Move all jupyter notebook examples into Example folder
2. Added more functionalities for BEM_element class which now can "set" and "get" solution values (P,U,V) for each element
4. Improved DDM solution efficiency by only update the load vector only without reassembling
3. Support Internal Geometry(Trace) now
4. The visulization part is improved, edge label will be shown for prescribing the boundary conditions
