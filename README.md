`PyBEM2D` is a open source boundary element library for two dimensional geometries. It is designed for academic users to quickly learn and test various BEM's techniques under the framework of Python. With the modular code structure and easy-to-use interfaces to `PyBEM2D`, it is easy to get started and added more features for academic users. 

Currently available features include:
* Easy-to-use python interface for BEM meshing and post-processing
* Anistropic Potential problem
* Point collocation method for BEM discretization
* Support for constant,linear and quadratic element types
* Support for discontinous element to treat corner and boundary conditions issue
* Support internal point and line sources (traces)
* Near singular, singular integration is calculated by exact integration

Special feature:
* Multi-domain problem is solved by parallel domain decomposition method [Wang et al, 2018]

`PyBEM2D` is currently support for `64-bit` `Windows` and `Linux` platforms, several `Jupyter-Notebook` examples are provided.

`Anaconda 5.3` (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is required. If code is not working, please run `python setup.py build_ext -i clean` @ "PyBEM2D\BEM_Solver\Elements\" in terminal to compile the cython library for exact integration. The library works on both Windows and Linux.

After downloading and unzipping the current <a href="https://github.com/BinWang0213/PyBEM2D/archive/master.zip">repository</a>, navigate to the library directory and run a simple example contained in `Example/LSU_Traces.ipynb`:
```python
import PyBEM2D as BEMpy

BEM_Case1=BEMpy.BEM2D()

#1.Build Mesh
Boundary_vert=[(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.75), (0.0, 0.75)] #Anti-clock wise for internal domain

Trace_vert=[]
L=[((0.1, 0.15), (0.1, 0.6)),((0.1, 0.15), (0.3, 0.15))]
S=[((0.6,0.6),(0.38,0.6)),((0.38,0.6),(0.38,0.38)),((0.38,0.38),(0.6,0.38)),((0.6,0.38),(0.6,0.14)),((0.6,0.14),(0.38,0.14))]
U= [((0.72,0.6),(0.72,0.14)),((0.72,0.14),(0.92,0.14)),((0.92,0.14),(0.92,0.6))]
Points= [((0.195,0.35),(0.205,0.35)),
      ((0.795,0.35),(0.805,0.35))]
Trace_vert=L+S+U+Points
element_esize=0.2 #Edge mesh is important to overall mass balance
element_tszie=0.1 #Trace mesh size

BEM_Case1.set_Mesh(Boundary_vert,Trace_vert,element_esize,element_tszie,Type="Const")

#2.Set Boundary condition
bc0=[(4,50),(5,50),(11,50),(12,50),(13,50),(14,10),(15,10)]
bc1=[(6,-100),(7,-100),(8,-100),(9,-100),(10,-100)]
BEM_Case1.set_BoundaryCondition(DirichletBC=bc0,NeumannBC=bc1)

#3. Solve and plot
Mat=BEM_Case1.Solve()
PUV=BEM_Case1.plot_Solution(v_range=(-150,250),p_range=(30,50),resolution=30)
```
